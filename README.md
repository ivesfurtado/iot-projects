# IoT Projects

This is the repository where I keep my IoT projects.

## Environment Variables

Most of the projects will require environment variables. These variables should be set up in the `config` folder. Make sure to rename the `*.h.example` files to `*.h` and provide your own values for the variables.

## Getting Started

To use these projects, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- Arduino IDE (version 2.1.0)
- ESP8266 board library (generic)

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `project1/`: Contains the files related to Project 1.
  - `config/`: Environment variable files for Project 1.
  - `./`: Source code files for Project 1.

- `project2/`: Contains the files related to Project 2.
  - `config/`: Environment variable files for Project 2.
  - `./`: Source code files for Project 2.

Feel free to explore each project's directory to learn more about them.

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to any of the projects, feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions, improvements, and bug fixes are always welcome!
